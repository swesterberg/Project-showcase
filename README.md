# Project-showcase

The pdf contained in this repository is the written report detailing an FPGA project I have done as a part of a 4 person team.
The project focuses on using the capabilities of the FPGA to decode inputs and map them to interesting outputs. The appendix
containing the systemVerilog used in this project has been removed from the publicly available version to comply with OSU
academic honesty standards.
